`Quorum` is a permissioned private blockchain. forked from `geth` that allows you to run a private network.

```bash
npx quorum-dev-quickstart
cd quorum-test-network
./run.sh
```

It downloads all the necessary dependencies and docker images and starts the network. you can see the network on `http://localhost:25000/explorer/nodes` address.

```bash
docker ps -a
```
