# Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a static-site generator. It builds a single-page application with fast client-side navigation.  
It provides out-of-the-box documentation features but can be used to create any kind of site.

‚ö°Ô∏è Docusaurus will help you ship a beautiful documentation site in no time  
üí∏ Building a custom tech stack is expensive. Instead, focus on your content and just write Markdown files  
üí• Use advanced features like versioning, i18n, search and theme customizations
