When started for the first time, programs don’t know the IP addresses of any active full nodes. In order to discover some IP addresses, they query one or more DNS seeds hardcoded into Bitcoin Core and BitcoinJ. The response to the lookup should include one or more DNS A records with the IP addresses of full nodes that may accept new incoming connections.

The entire state of the system consists of a set of “unspent outputs” (think, “coins”), such that each coin has an owner and a value, and a transaction spends one or more coins and creates one or more new coins, subject to the validity constraints: Every referenced input must be valid and not yet spentThe transaction must have a signature matching the owner of the input for every inputThe total value of the inputs must equal or exceed the total value of the outputs A user’s “balance” in the system is thus the total value of the set of coins for which the user has a private key capable of producing a valid signature. Triple-entry bookkeeping example (Image from https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide) Ethereum jettisons this scheme in favor of a simpler approach: the state stores a list of accounts where each account has a balance, as well as Ethereum-specific data (code and internal storage), and a transaction is valid if the sending account has enough balance to pay for it, in which case the sending account is debited and the receiving account is credited with the value. If the receiving account has code, the code runs, and internal storage may also be changed, or the code may even create additional messages to other accounts which lead to further debits and credits. The benefits of UTXOs are: Higher degree of privacy: if a user uses a new address for each transaction that they receive then it will often be difficult to link accounts to each other. This applies greatly to currency, but less to arbitrary dapps, as arbitrary dapps often necessarily involve keeping track of complex bundled state of users and there may not exist such an easy user state partitioning scheme as in currency.Potential scalability paradigms: UTXOs are more theoretically compatible with certain kinds of scalability paradigms, as we can rely on only the owner of some coins maintaining a Merkle proof of ownership, and even if everyone including the owner decides to forget that data then only the owner is harmed. In an account paradigm, everyone losing the portion of a Merkle tree corresponding to an account would make it impossible to process messages that affect that account at all in any way, including sending to it. However, non-UTXO-dependent scalability paradigms do exist. The benefits of accounts are: Large space savings: for example, if an account has 5 UTXO, then switching from a UTXO model to an account model would reduce the space requirements from (20 + 32 + 8) * 5 = 300 bytes (20 for the address, 32 for the txid and 8 for the value) to 20 + 8 + 2 = 30 bytes (20 for the address, 8 for the value, 2 for a nonce(see below)). In reality savings are not nearly this massive because accounts need to be stored in a Patricia tree (see below) but they are nevertheless large. Additionally, transactions can be smaller (eg. 100 bytes in Ethereum vs. 200-250 bytes in Bitcoin) because every transaction need only make one reference and one signature and produces one output.Greater fungibility: because there is no blockchain-level concept of the source of a specific set of coins, it becomes less practical, both technically and legally, to institute a redlist/blacklisting scheme and to draw a distinction between coins depending on where they come from.Simplicity: easier to code and understand, especially once more complex scripts become involved. Although it is possible to shoehorn arbitrary decentralized applications into a UTXO paradigm, essentially by giving scripts the ability to restrict what kinds of UTXO a given UTXO can be spent to, and requiring spends to include Merkle tree proofs of change-of-application-state-root that scripts evaluate, such a paradigm is much more complicated and ugly than just using accounts.Constant light client reference: light clients can at any point access all data related to an account by scanning down the state tree in a specific direction. In a UTXO paradigm, the references change with each transaction, a particularly burdensome problem for long-running dapps that try to use the above mentioned state-root-in-UTXO propagation mechanism. We have decided that, particularly because we are dealing with dapps containing arbitrary state and code, the benefits of accounts massively outweigh the alternatives. Additionally, in the spirit of the We Have No Features principle, we note that if people really do care about privacy then mixers and coinjoin can be built via signed-data-packet protocols inside of contracts. One weakness of the account paradigm is that in order to prevent replay attacks, every transaction must have a nonce, such that the account keeps track of the nonces used and only accepts a transaction if its nonce is 1 after the last nonce used. This means that even no-longer-used accounts can never be pruned from the account state. A simple solution to this problem is to require transactions to contain a block number, making them un-repayable after some period of time, and reset nonces once every period. Miners or other users will need to “ping” unused accounts in order to delete them from the state, as it would be too expensive to do a full sweep as part of the blockchain protocol itself. We did not go with this mechanism only to speed up development for 1.0; 1.1 and beyond will likely use such a system.

Transactions are grouped into blocks. Blocks are grouped into epochs. In a chain, the set of blocks that belongs to some epoch forms a contiguous range. Each epoch is associated with a set of block producers responsible for validating blocks within that epoch. The information for an epoch is determined by the last block. Therefore, if two chains share the last block of some epoch, they will have the same set and the same assignment for the next two epochs, but not necessarily for any epoch after that. The consensus protocol defines a notion of finality, which helps ensure that transactions in a final block (and preceding blocks) are irreversible. In NEAR a consensus node (block producer) doesn’t validate an entire block, but rather specified chunks of each block. NEAR relies on its own variant of consensus algorithm known as Doomslug. Doomslug ensures that a block is irreversible unless at least one participant is slashed, providing practical finality. Anyone can become a block producer and/or validator on NEAR as long as they have NEAR tokens to lock as collateral. Thresholded Proof-of-Stake​ In PoS systems, nodes participate in decisions proportionally to the amount of money they have. One common implementation of PoS is Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS), where the network votes for delegates who maintain the network and make decisions on behalf of other members. However, this can lead to centralization and a small number of nodes controlling network maintenance medium.com. TPoS aims to address these issues by using an election mechanism that deterministically selects a large number of participants for network maintenance, thereby increasing decentralization and security. This method is similar to an auction, where people bid for a fixed number of items, and the top N bids win while receiving a number of items proportional to the size of their bids medium.com. Doomslug​ At the beginning of every epoch (1/2 day) the set of largest stake-weighted participants on the network are selected. In short, Doomslug works by having a set of participants take turns to produce and broadcast blocks. Once a block at height h is received by other participants, they send endorsements on such a block to the participant assigned to the next height h+1. If after some predetermined time the participant assigned to h+1 hasn’t produced a block, the participants who sent an endorsement to her send another message to the participant assigned to h+2 indicating that they suggest skipping the block at h+1.  NEAR does not have explicit slashing for availability (liveness). However, if a validator is not responsive enough at every epoch (fulfilling with minimum threshold of chunks), they will drop out of the consensus set and lose the rewards from the epoch. Once that happens, the validator must re-stake the tokens. What refers to as practical finality, or doomslug finality is that a block produced by Doomslug is irreversible unless at least one participant is slashed. Doomslug also has a nice property that it continues producing and finalizing blocks for as long as just over half of all the participants are online and honest ","version":null,"tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Accounts​","type":1,"pageTitle":"NEAR","url":"/Wisdom-Hub/blockchain/NEAR/#accounts","content":"Every account at NEAR belongs to some shard.

For example, if Alice has a balance of 1 Ⓝ, she can store roughly 10 kilobytes on her account. This means that users need to maintain a fraction of Ⓝ as a minimum balance if they want to have their account, similar to how checking accounts in banks require a minimum balance. This allows contracts which are maintaining important state to pay to Validators proportionally to the amount of data they are securing.

Nightshade splits the work of processing transactions and states across many participats (shards) to ensure the network can scale as it grows in users and demand. It calls State Sharding. Each shard contains its own data and can process transactions independently of the others. Practically, under State Sharding the nodes in each shard are building their own blockchain that contains transactions that affect only the local part of the global state that is assigned to that shard. Therefore, the validators in the shard only need to store their local part of the global state and only execute, and as such only relay, transactions that affect their part of the state Nightshade also introduces Dynamic Resharding which allows the network to dynamically split and merge shards based on demand and resource utilization. Picture below shows a chain shared to 10. also shows how many corrupted node is needed to corrupt a shard.  Beacon Chain is a layer-1 blockchain that coordinates the activities of the shard chains. Beacon chain do some bookkeeping computation, such as assigning validators to shards (randomness), or snapshotting shard chain blocks, that is proportional to the number of shards in the system.

Smart contracts are pieces of executable code stored in the account's state that have their own storage, and perform transactions in the account's name. NEAR smart contract are a bit different from ethereum. If you’re familiar with Ethereum’s pricing model, you may know that, like NEAR, the protocol charges a fee (called gas) for each transaction. Unlike NEAR, Ethereum's gas fee accounts for the amount of data stored via that transaction. This essentially means that anyone can pay once to store permanent data on-chain. But how NEAR works: Let's walk through an example: You launch a guest book app, deploying your app's smart contract to the account example.nearVisitors to your app can add messages to the guest book. This means your users will, by default, pay a small gas fee to send their message to your contract.When such a call comes in, NEAR will check that example.near has a enough balance that it can stake an amount to cover the new storage needs. If it does not, the transaction will fail. btw, you can remove data to unstake some tokens​. Each NEAR account can only hold 1 smart contract. You can always re-deploy a smart contract on an account.

The first problem with Nightshade is that now we have Two concepts instead of one: transactions AND receipts. In NEAR, transactions are not changing the state of the shard much, but receipts are. receipts will be executed in the receiver shard. They also will be included in the next block. And now it is not easy to NOT execute the original transaction (already mined in the last block) which could prevent the token loss. now that the transaction is executed (and account is deleted) we have to execute the receipts (including the refund receipt).

While it opens a wide range of possibilities for smart contracts implementations, it may also add to confusion among beginners and newcomers from other blockchain platforms. Transactions in NEAR may contain actions that do asynchronous work, in such cases keep in mind the possible outcomes of success or failure of the transaction. For example, if a transaction contains a cross-contract call, it may be marked as successful, but the other contract execution might fail. This article covers possible scenarios for this. A transaction is the smallest unit of work that can be assigned to the network. Work in this case means compute (executing a function) or storage (reading/writing data). A transaction is composed of one or more Actions. A transaction with more than one action is referred to as a batch transaction. Since transactions are the smallest units of work, they are also atomic, but again, asynchronous actions do not necessarily cascade their success or failure the whole transaction. There is also a concept of Receipt, which is either request to apply an Action or result of the Action. All cross-contract communication is done through receipts. An action may result in one or more receipts. The Blockchain may be seen as a series of Transactions, but it's also a series of Receipts. A Transaction is a collection of Actions that describe what should be done at the destination (the receiver account). Each Transaction is augmented with critical information about its: origin (cryptographically signed by signer)destination or intention (sent or applied to receiver)recency (block_hash from recent block within acceptable limits - 1 epoch)uniqueness (nonce must be unique for a given signer AccessKey) An Action is a composable unit of operation that, together with zero or more other Actions, defines a sensible Transaction. There are currently 8 supported Action types: FunctionCall to invoke a method on a contract (and optionally attach a budget for compute and storage)Transfer to move tokens from between accountsDeployContract to deploy a contractCreateAccount to make a new account (for a person, contract, refrigerator, etc.)DeleteAccount to delete an account (and transfer the balance to a beneficiary account)AddKey to add a key to an account (either FullAccess or FunctionCall access)DeleteKey to delete an existing key from an accountStake to express interest in becoming a validator at the next available opportunity A Receipt is the only actionable object in the system. Therefore, when we talk about processing a transaction on the NEAR platform, this eventually means applying receipts at some point There are several ways of creating Receipts: issuing a Transactionreturning a promise (related to cross-contract calls)issuing a refund Due to NEAR asynchronous design and Nightshade algorithm. Transactions (or receipts) are not being processed in one block. instead they create receipts which will be executed in the next block(s), and also those receipts may generate other receipt, that will be included and executed in the next block(s).

Stream Claim Name A controlling stream claim. lbry://meet-lbry Channel Claim Name A controlling channel claim. lbry://@lbry Channel Claim Name and Stream Claim Name A URL containing both a channel and a stream claim name. URLs containing both are resolved in two steps. First, the channel is resolved to its associated claim. Then the stream claim name is resolved to get the appropriate claim from among the claims in the channel. lbry://@lbry/meet-lbry Claim ID A claim for this name with this claim ID.

MLBs is the contract we have already deployed on the Goerli testnet. An standdard OpenZeppelin ERC-1155. This contract contains two tokens only: MLBFun which is a fungible token with id 0MLBNFun which is a non-fungible token with id 1 We'll map this contract and transfer some tokens. You can find a step-by-step guide to creating an ERC-1155 token here Contract info: Name: MLBs Tokens: MLBFun, MLBNFun Owner: 0xD8f24D419153E5D03d614C5155f900f4B5C8A65C Contract Address: 0x11C47A4F19cc52923b9C495080ADB441ADe38883 Goerli etherscan: https://goerli.etherscan.io/address/0x11C47A4F19cc52923b9C495080ADB441ADe38883  Gather this information for the contract you intend to map. Wallet Balance using Web3js ERC-1155 contracts have a balanceOf function. It takes two arguments: Wallet Address: The address, for example, the contract owner (0xD8f24D419153E5D03d614C5155f900f4B5C8A65C)TokenID: The token ID. For example, 0 refers to the MLBFun token in our ERC-1155 contract  If you have already configured a provider and the truffle-hdwallet-provider, you can use this function to check your ERC-1155 tokens. async function getTokenBalance(web3, address, contractABI, contractAddress) { let contractInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABI, contractAddress); let result = await contractInstance.methods.balanceOf(address, 0).call() // 0 is a tokenID console.log(`TokenID ${0}:` , result); result = await contractInstance.methods.balanceOf(address, 1).call() // 1 is a tokenID console.log(`TokenID ${1}:` , result); }  The balanceOf output for our contract in Goerli would be like: TokenID 0: 7000000000000000000 TokenID 1: 1  And for Mumbai: TokenID 0: 0 TokenID 1: 0  The full source code is: const Web3 = require(&quot;web3&quot;); const HDWalletProvider = require(&quot;@truffle/hdwallet-provider&quot;) const secrets = require('./secrets.json') let address = &quot;0xD8f24D419153E5D03d614C5155f900f4B5C8A65C&quot;; // The address to check balance of let contractAddressInMumbai = &quot;0x7242B6E18F85DB7b2A19d027e0b81Dcf6637C68b&quot;; // Mumbai Contract Address let contractABIMumbai = [{&quot;inputs&quot;:[{&quot;internalType&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;MLBF.......&quot;}]}] let contractAddressGoerli = &quot;0x11C47A4F19cc52923b9C495080ADB441ADe38883&quot;; // Goerli Contract Address let contractABIGoerli = [{&quot;inputs&quot;:[{&quot;internalType&quot;:&quot;uint256&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;MLBF.......&quot;}]}] const provider = new HDWalletProvider(secrets.privateKey, secrets.mumbai); // mumbai Provider // const provider = new HDWalletProvider(secrets.privateKey, secrets.localGeth); // Goerli Provider const web3 = new Web3(provider); (async () =&gt; { try { await getBalance() } catch (e) { console.log(e) } })() async function getBalance() { let contractInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(contractABIMumbai, contractAddressInMumbai); let result = await contractInstance.methods.balanceOf(address, 0).call() console.log(`TokenID ${0}:` , result); result = await contractInstance.methods.balanceOf(address, 1).call() console.log(`TokenID ${1}:` , result); }  secrets.json: contains Seed, privateKey of the address (0xd8f2).

Let's map our MLBs contract. Go to mapper.matic.today and complete the form Make sure the token you want to map has had its contract verified on Etherscan Choose Gorli Testnet -&gt; Mumbai testnet At this time the mapping process is not immediate. It can take up to 3 days to be confirmed. Then open mapper.matic.today, and enter the contract address to see if it has been added.  As you may notice, the contract address in Goerli and Mumbai is not the same. Let's remember to add it to Metamask so it shows up when we are connected to Mumbai as well. Open MetamaskSelect the Mumbai testnet from the list of available networksAdd TokenPaste the contract address there (0x7242B6E18F85DB7b2A19d027e0b81Dcf6637C68b) We don't yet have any tokens in Mumbai. We can transfer some across the bridge and check our balance again afterward. Transfer using SDK Let's take a look at the workflow for transferring tokens with the SDK: Approve: The owner of the token has to approve the Ethereum Predicate Contract which will lock the amount of token they want to transfer to Polygon.Deposit: Then a function has to be called on the RootChainManger contract which will trigger the ChildChainManager contract on the Mumbai testnet. The ChildChainManager contract will then call the deposit function of the Child token contract. Child contract is the copy of the Goerli token contract in Mumbai.

Once it has synced, then we can check the token balance via web3js. The balanceOf output for our contract in Goerli would be like: TokenID 0: 6999999999999998935 TokenID 1: 1  And for Mumbai: TokenID 0: 999 TokenID 1: 0  Transfer using Web UI Transferring assets through Web UI is pretty simple. Just like the SDK, there is the Approve and a Deposit steps. Open mintnft Make sure Goerli Testnet is selected in Metamask Enter the contract address in Goerli and Mumbai, and ID of the token you want to transfer. We put 0 (MLBFun) Click on Approve Then review the transaction details, like gas fees and the smart contract you are sending tokens to - before clicking on Confirm Now, wait until you receive confirmations. Metamask and the website both will send a notification. Now Click on Deposit Once the transaction is mined, the process is complete! It takes about 7 minutes to complete the transfer. As mentioned before Polygon needs about 5 minutes to sync. Conclusion Congratulations! By completing this tutorial you learned how to use the Polygon PoS Bridge. We have configured Metamask and Geth, to communicate with the Goerli testnet and the Mumbai testnet. We then mapped an ERC-1155 contract between the networks so it can be transferred via the bridge. Finally, we called functions on the PoS Bridge contracts and moved our assets from Ethereum to Polygon. About The Author I'm mlibre, a random guy from the solar galaxy.

Because Web UI only supports Ethereum and Polygon mainnets. So I am going to transfer some real tokens from my Ethereum account to Polygon and pay the fees. You may just follow the images below to see how the process works. Open wallet.polygon.technology Make sure Ethereum Mainnet is selected in Metamask Click on Metamask. first login option You will be asked to sign a Signature Request to make sure you have access to the wallet.

It takes about 7 minutes to complete the transfer, as mentioned before Polygon needs about 5 minutes to sync. Conclusion Congratulations! By completing this tutorial you learned how to use the Polygon PoS Bridge. We have configured Metamask and Geth, to communicate with the Goerli testnet and the Mumbai testnet. We then mapped an ERC-20 token between the networks so it can be transferred via the bridge. Finally, we called functions on the PoS Bridge contracts and moved our assets from Ethereum to Polygon.

Wallet Balance using Web3js ERC-721 contracts have a balanceOf function. It takes Wallet Address as an argument and returns the balance. If you have already configured a provider and the truffle-hdwallet-provider, you can use this function to check your ERC-721 token info and balance. async function getBalance(web3, contract, contractAddress) { let contractInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI, contractAddress); let result = await contractInstance.methods.balanceOf(address).call() console.log(`Balance:` , result); }  The balanceOf output for our contract in Goerli would be like: Balance: 1  And for Mumbai: Balance: 0  The full source code is: const Web3 = require(&quot;web3&quot;); const HDWalletProvider = require(&quot;@truffle/hdwallet-provider&quot;) const secrets = require('./secrets.json') let address = &quot;0xD8f24D419153E5D03d614C5155f900f4B5C8A65C&quot;; // The address to check balance of let contractAddressGoerli = &quot;0xcCE32d5A6B433972fA3Ff21233470D60ab7AFD6b&quot;; // Goerli Contract Address let contractAddressInMumbai = &quot;0xf6320326327c07759602423f01D8fad4AF9E3f24&quot;; // Mumbai Contract Address let ABI = [{&quot;inputs&quot;:[],&quot;s...&quot;}] // const provider = new HDWalletProvider(secrets.privateKey, secrets.localGeth); // Goerli Provider const provider = new HDWalletProvider(secrets.privateKey, secrets.mumbai); // mumbai Provider const web3 = new Web3(provider); (async () =&gt; { try { await getBalance() } catch (e) { console.log(e) } })() async function getBalance() { let contractInstance = new web3.eth.Contract(ABI, contractAddressInMumbai); let result = await contractInstance.methods.balanceOf(address).call() console.log(`Balance` , result); }  secrets.json: contains Seed, privateKey of the address (0xd8f2).

Go to mapper.matic.today and complete the form Make sure the token you want to map has had its contract verified on Etherscan Choose Gorli Testnet -&gt; Mumbai testnet At this time the mapping process is not immediate. It can take up to 3 days to be confirmed. Then open mapper.matic.today, and enter the contract address to see if it has been added.  As you may notice, the contract address in Goerli and Mumbai is not the same. Let's remember to add it to Metamask so it shows up when we are connected to Mumbai as well. Open MetamaskSelect the Mumbai testnet from the list of available networksAdd TokenPaste the contract address there (0xf6320326327c07759602423f01D8fad4AF9E3f24) We don't yet have any tokens in Mumbai. We can transfer some across the bridge and check our balance again afterward. Transfer using SDK Let's take a look at the workflow for transferring tokens with the SDK: Approve: The owner of the token has to approve the Ethereum Predicate Contract which will lock the amount of token they want to transfer to Polygon.Deposit: Then a function has to be called on the RootChainManger contract which will trigger the ChildChainManager contract on the Mumbai testnet. The ChildChainManager contract will then call the deposit function of the Child token contract. The Child contract is the copy of the Goerli testnet token contract in Mumbai testnet.

Just like the SDK, there is the Approve and a Deposit steps. Open MintNFT Bridge Make sure Goerli Testnet is selected in Metamask Enter the contract address in Goerli and Mumbai, and ID of the token you want to transfer. We put 1 (MLBn) Click on Approve Then review the transaction details, like gas fees and the smart contract you are sending tokens to - before clicking on Confirm Now, wait until you receive confirmations. Metamask and the website both will send a notification. Now Click on Deposit Once the transaction is mined, the process is complete! It takes about 7 minutes to complete the transfer. As mentioned before Polygon needs about 5 minutes to sync. Conclusion Congratulations! By completing this tutorial you learned how to use the Polygon PoS Bridge. We have configured Metamask and Geth, to communicate with the Goerli testnet and the Mumbai testnet. We then mapped an ERC-721 contract between the networks so it can be transferred via the bridge.
