# Prompt

## Markdown table of Linux commands

Please provide a Markdown table with centered text alignment that lists the following Linux commands, their short descriptions and examples: "free", "uptime"
The table has two columns only: 'Command', 'Description'.
Make sure examples are real-world examples and are very useful.
The table format is:

```markdown
|               Command               | Description |
| :---------------------------------: | :---------: |
|             `command1`              | Description |
|       `example of command 1`        | Description |
|   `advance example of command 1`    | Description |
| `very advance example of command 1` | Description |
|             `command2`              | Description |
