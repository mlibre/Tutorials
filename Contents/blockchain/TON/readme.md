# TON

TON is a proof-of-stake blockchain

## TON Network

The `TON` project extends beyond a conventional `blockchain`, incorporating a unique network technology. The `TON network`, fully decentralized, secure, and private, operates as a powerful peer-to-peer network similar to `TOR` or `I2P`.

## Network Characteristics

- **Decentralized:** Operates on a peer-to-peer network with no centralized servers.
- **Stable:** Network functionality remains unaffected by offline nodes.
- **Anonymous:** Difficult to identify a node's IP address.
- **Encrypted:** Data sent to nodes is encrypted.
- **Protocols:** Utilizes UDP/IP and TCP/IP internet protocols.

## TON Blockchain and TON Network Integration

The `TON network` is deeply integrated with the `TON blockchain`, Toncoin cryptocurrency, and TON services, creating a synergistic relationship that elevates the technology to a new level.

## TON Sites

- Web servers can be launched on the `TON network`, creating TON Sites.
- Mandatory encryption and data authenticity verification ensure secure data traffic.

## TON DNS

`TON DNS`, a service by TON Foundation, facilitates assigning human-readable names to crypto wallets, smart contracts, and websites on The Open Network

Key Features:

- Fully decentralized domain name system for TON Sites
- Annual micropayment to confirm domain ownership

## User Authentication

- No registration needed on TON; users sign in with TON-based crypto wallets.
- Eliminates the need for multiple passwords and avoids exposure of email addresses.

## TON WWW: The TON World Wide Web

TON WWW encompasses web pages and services accessible via the TON network, utilizing hyperlinks in a specific format:

```bash
ton://domain/<method>?<field1>=<value1>&<field2>..
```

## TON Proxy

- Connect to `TON network` through entry proxies
- Proxy compatible with HTTP Proxy for browsing TON Sites
- Future integration with TON wallets for direct access

### TON Proxy 2.0 Update

- Intermediary proxy nodes for enhanced privacy
- Data routed through a swarm of nodes via garlic routing
- Full anonymity in the TON network

### TON Proxy 3.0 — Decentralized Finance

- Launch of decentralized Toncoin economy.
- Payment through Payment Network technology.
- Intermediary proxy nodes receive micropayments for internet traffic.
- Payments charged and deducted from users’ crypto wallets.
- Decentralized payments system enables administrators to run nodes globally.
- Addresses scalability issues through financial incentives for network support.

## Future Developments

- Anticipating updates dedicated to privacy and decentralized finance.
- Aiming to address the shortcomings of the modern internet, focusing on privacy, security, and scalability.

The TON project introduces a decentralized, secure, and reliable alternative to the conventional World Wide Web, addressing contemporary challenges and paving the way for a more private and user-centric online experience.
